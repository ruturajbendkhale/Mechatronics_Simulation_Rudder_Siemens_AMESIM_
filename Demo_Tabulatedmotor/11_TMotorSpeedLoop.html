<h2><u>Purpose</u></h2>
<p>This demonstration presents a tabulated motor speed control with a varying mechanical load.</p>

<h2><u>Description</u></h2>
<p>Electric machines and the associated power converters can be complex to model.
For example, saturation phenomena in machine air gaps or power electronics losses for specific system may not be entirely understood.
Moreover, getting into a greater level of details might require additional computation time that are incompatible with large system modeling.
In order to deal with these modeling issues, it can be interesting to use functional models with average behavior based on observations or measurements.</p>
<p>The EMD tabulated motor model represent a complete electric powertrain using data files to define the machine and its converter losses for a given control.
It is therefore adapted to large system models where average energetic transfers are the main issue but high dynamics are not of first interest.</p>
<p>In this example we propose to build a speed control loop for this motor, with a varying mechanical load.
The model sketch is represented on Figure 1:</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1: Tabulated motor speed control loop model</b></p>
<p>This example control loop features a PI controller.
The tabulated motor uses two data files to define the maximum and minimum torque the motor can handle,
a saturation limitation is therefore in the loop implicitly. The machine is supplied with electric power with a constant DC voltage source.</p>

<p>The motor and load torque are illustrated on Figure 2:</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2: Motor and load torque on inertia</b></p>

<p>We observe that the motor torque balances the load torque.
It is even higher, since there is additional viscous friction on the inertia.
The speed, however, is not perfectly regulated to the reference velocity value, so that a different equilibrium point is reached between 4 [s] and 6 [s] (Figure 3):</p>

<p>Figure 4 explains the problem of regulation due to the machine's torque saturation:</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 4: Torque characteristics and equilibrium points</b></p>

<p>The resistive torque is due to the load torque and the viscous friction on the inertia.
When the load torque rises, the resistive torque characteristic is translated along the Y axis.
For different values of load torque, a set of resistive torque characteristics can be drawn
(
\(\Gamma res1(\Omega)\)
to 
\(\Gamma res8(\Omega)\)
).</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>On 
\(\Gamma res1(\Omega)\)
: the load torque is null.
To reach the reference speed
\(\Omega ref\)
,
the motor has to provide
\(\Gamma m\)
so that the equilibrium point is M.</li>
<li>
On
\(\Gamma res2(\Omega)\)
:
the load torque rises a little, the motor is still able to reach the reference speed and the equilibrium point goes to N.</li>
<li>
On
\(\Gamma res3(\Omega)\)
: O is a limit where the reference speed can still be reached.
The motor torque reaches its maximum.</li>
<li>
On
\(\Gamma res4(\Omega)\)
: the motor is not able to keep the speed to the reference objective.
For example the P point cannot be an equilibrium since the motor cannot provide
\(\Gamma p\)
.
</li>
<li>On
\(\Gamma res5(\Omega)\)
: the system is in the same situation as on
\(\Gamma res4(\Omega)\)

The equilibrium point is on the bold line, and the motor speed becomes
\(\Omega eff\)
.
</li>
<li>On
\(\Gamma res6(\Omega)\)
: likewise, the R point cannot be reached.
\(\Gamma res6(\Omega)\)
is a limit where the motor speed is zero.
The motor can only match the load torque but cannot rotate.</li>
<li>
On
\(\Gamma res7(\Omega)\)
:
The equilibrium point changes quadrant, the machine can only brake and works as a generator as it rotates in the opposite direction.
</li>
<li>
On
\(\Gamma res8(\Omega)\)
: The load torque is too high and the machine cannot brake enough.
The speed is limited by the friction force.
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>The problem of motor saturation is illustrated by Figure 5.
We observe that torque commands higher than approximately 182 [Nm] cannot be reached:</p>

<p>This torque limit, at the speed when saturation occurs (around 2426 [rpm]), can also be seen by launching the Table visualization 
tool, attached to the <a href="../../../libemd/doc/html/submodels/EMDTMF01.html">EMDTMF01</a> submodel: </p>
